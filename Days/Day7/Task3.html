        <h4>ONE PIECE</h4>
        <p>
            A man is handcuffed and in front of him there are two other men with swords, crossing into an "X". 
            <strong>There was once a man who took everything in the world: wealth, fame and power</strong>, known as <strong>Pirate King Gold Roger.</strong> 
            The pirate's last words drove people throughout the world to the sea. 
            Roger announces that if someone wants his treasure, he or she can have it, saying that he left everything "there". 
            Roger is executed, and the entire crowd, including a man with a pirate symbol on his hand, is cheering. 
            The world has entered the <b>Golden Age of Piracy.</b>
            In a small seaport village, a pirate ship landed almost one year ago. 
            The east wind blows.<small><mark>It is a small peaceful village.</mark></small> 
            A boy is standing on the ship's figurehead. 
            A man asks Luffy what he is doing. 
            The child's full name is revealed to be <em><strong>Monkey D. Luffy.</strong></em> 
            He has a knife in his left hand, and he is wearing a shirt with <ins>"ANCHOR"</ins> written on it. 
            He announces that he is not joking this time as he had enough, and he decides to prove it for everyone. 
            The man is wearing a straw hat and he tells <i><u>Luffy</u></i> to go for it to see what he is going to do. 
            Another man claims that the kid is going to do something funny again. 
            The child stabs himself with the knife right under his eye, <del>screaming in pain</del>. 
            All the pirates are surprised because of this. 
            The first man shouts asking Luffy what he is doing.
            In the village, the pirates and the boy have gathered in the Partys Bar. 
            <mark>Ten years later, Luffy leaves the village to start his own pirate crew and begin the journey of becoming the Pirate King.</mark>
