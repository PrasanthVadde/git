    <fieldset>
        Determine Applicable Laws: Start by identifying the legal framework that applies to your business. Consider local, state, and federal laws that impact your operations. 
        Create an Outline: Make an organized outline for your terms and conditions. This will help you structure the agreement effectively.
        Select Relevant Clauses: Choose clauses that are pertinent to your business. Common clauses include those related to acceptable use, intellectual property rights, dispute resolution, and limitations of liability.
        Use Clear Language: Write your terms and conditions in straightforward language. Avoid legal jargon to ensure users can easily understand their rights and obligations. 
        Link to Other Policies: Include links to other relevant legal documents, such as your privacy policy, cookie policy, return and refund policy, and end-user license agreement (EULA).
        Display Agreements: Post your completed terms and conditions agreement in multiple places on your platform. This ensures users are aware of the rules they must follow. <br>
