            <h1>Chapter 1 "Cruelty"</h1>
            
            <p>
                A young boy carries a visibly-wounded, unconscious girl through a snowy path on his back. 
                This girl is revealed to be his younger sister, Nezuko. He treks frantically through the snow and begs her to stay alive, vowing that her big brother would save her.
                As New Year is about to arrives, Tanjiro Kamado prepares to leave home to sell some charcoal in order to have enough food on the table for the holiday. 
                His younger siblings, Hanako and Shigeru, overhear him and beg to go as well, but their mother sternly refuses, saying they would only cause him trouble. 
                Tanjiro calls out to his younger brother, Takeo, and asks him to chop the firewood while he's away, much to the latter's disappointment as he hints that he wanted to chop wood with his older brother. 
                Tanjiro bids farewell to his mother and siblings as they remind him to stay safe. 
                As he sets off, he runs into Nezuko, rocking their youngest sibling, Rokuta, to sleep. 
                She mentions their younger siblings' attachment to Tanjiro since their father's death and bids him goodbye.
                As he travels, he remarks that they have always made the most of their life, since it can change so quickly so suddenly. 
                As Tanjiro arrives in the town, everyone is delighted to see him and immediately call him over to buy some of his charcoal. 
                One of the villagers cries out to Tanjiro and asks him to take a whiff of a broken plate to figure out who the culprit was. 
                The boy's keen sense of smell is able to detect that it was a cat at fault and not the villager who was being held responsible for it.
                As the sun begins to set, Tanjiro begins his journey home, but as he begins to ascend the mountain, he is stopped by an elder by the name of Saburo, who forbids him from going back to the mountains as the sky turns dark. 
                He tells him not to worry as his nose can quickly smell out danger, but the man insists he take refuge in his house for the night in case of a demon attack. 
                Inside Saburo's hut, Tanjiro asks if demons could enter homes. 
                Saburo answers so and further states that it is the job of Demon Slayers to protect them. 
                Saburo, who lost his family to demons years ago, is pitied by Tanjiro, while remembering that his grandmother too had said something about demons before her death.
                At dawn, Tanjiro departs from Saburo's residence and makes his way back. 
                Outside his yard, he sees a bloodied Nezuko holding Rokuta lying on the snowy ground. 
                Horrified, he goes to check the house and is shocked to see his home destroyed and everyone inside brutally killed. 
                As Nezuko is the only one with warmth in her body, Tanjiro hurriedly carries her on his back to see a doctor. 
                Questions begin to flood Tanjiro's mind as he wonders if a bear was responsible for the attack. 
                The blizzard makes it difficult for him to breathe and he struggles to make his way to the town. 
                Suddenly, Nezuko rears up, growling and with fangs in her mouth; she pulls back on Tanjiro and causes both of them to fall off a cliff. 
                The thick snow protects Tanjiro from the fall.
                He finds Nezuko standing upright and asks if she is okay, only to be suddenly attacked by her. 
                Tanjiro is forced to jam his hatchet into her mouth to prevent getting bit as he realizes to his horror that Nezuko is now a demon. 
                He questions why, since she was born human, despite her now smelling of death and blood. 
                However, he remembers that she was lying over Rokuta and didn't have the blood of her family on her, noting that another scent was inside the house. 
                She grows in size and gains strength, Tanjiro struggling to hold her back. 
                He laments that his family has died brutally whilst he was away. 
                Tanjiro starts attempting to appeal to what is left of his sister's humanity, encouraging her to stop and do her best to not give into being a demon. 
                Eventually, she ceases her struggle and starts to cry; upon seeing his sister's tears, Tanjiro cries as well.
                Suddenly, a swordsman strikes at Nezuko: Tanjiro rolls himself and Nezuko away to avoid the attack. 
                The katana-wielding man asks why Tanjiro was protecting a demon. 
                Although Tanjiro tells him that the demon is his sister, the man insists on killing her, before lunging forward and grabbing hold of Nezuko, too fast for Tanjiro to react. 
                He states that it is his job as a Demon Slayer to kill them and prepares to behead her. 
                Tanjiro begs for her life and claims she has not killed anyone, wondering why she was turned into a demon in the first place, only for the man to respond that since demon blood has enter her through injuries, she has transformed into one. 
                He promises to make a cure but the Demon Slayer tells him becoming a demon is irreversible.
                Unwilling to let the last of his family die, Tanjiro kneels down and begs for Nezuko to be spared. 
                The man grows angry and rebukes him for his weak resolve, stating that a weak person cannot avenge his family or return his sister into a human again. 
                He demands that Tanjiro fight for something, claiming that demons may know how to change someone back but will not respect whining and crying, adding that he doesn't respect Tanjiro as well. 
                Inside, the swordsman chastises himself for being late but refuses to dwell further. 
                Despite knowing the great pain Tanjiro is experiencing, he begs the boy to keep his anger in his heart, as it will push him to do what he must.
                While Tanjiro is left forlorn, the swordsman stabs Nezuko in the chest, causing her great pain. 
                Tanjiro immediately throws a rock at him and charges. 
                The man becomes angry over what was merely an emotionally-charged attack. 
                He knocks Tanjiro unconscious but notices that he was not carrying his hatchet. 
                He looks up into the sky and ducks out of the way of the falling hatchet, barely missing him. 
                Through this carefully-planned assault by the young boy, the swordsman becomes aware of Tanjiro's resolve to protect his sister, sacrificing even his own life in order to save her from him. 
                While the swordsman is distracted, Nezuko breaks free of his hold and rushes to Tanjiro's motionless body. 
                The swordsman curses himself for letting his guard down, expecting Nezuko to devour her brother.
                However, she instead defends her unconscious brother, using her own body to shield him. 
                The man recalls many a time that someone too had said the same about their demon-turned relative, only to be eaten since demons will even feed on family members. 
                Seeing her injuries, he notes that she is spending energy to heal and yet refrains from killing Tanjiro. 
                Realizing that these siblings are different, he opts to spare Nezuko, sheathing his katana and knocking her unconscious instead. 
                As he is unconscious, Tanjiro dreams that his dead mother and siblings were surrounding him. 
                His mother apologizes for leaving him and tells him that she will be entrusting Nezuko to his care.
                Tanjiro wakes up with tears in his eyes, and Nezuko, with a bamboo muzzle in her mouth to prevent her from biting him, laid unconscious but alive beside him. 
                Having waiting for him to awaken, the swordsman appears behind a tree and asks them to look for an elder named Sakonji Urokodaki, who lives at the foot of Mount Sagiri, and to tell him that Giyu Tomioka sent them. 
                Before disappearing, he advises Tanjiro to not bring his sister out in the sun, before disappearing. 
                Tanjiro buries the dead members of his family beside their house while Nezuko looks on. 
                The Kamado siblings take each others' hands and starts on their journey to look for Sakonji.

            <h1>Chapter 2 "The Stranger"</h1>
            <p>
                Following Giyu's advice to keep Nezuko away from the sun, Tanjiro opts to buy a basket from a nearby farmer to protect her in the day. 
                The farmer offers to give it for free since it is damaged but Tanjiro insists on paying. 
                Again, he refuses money and adds that he can take the straw and bamboo for free. 
                Tanjiro stubbornly wants to give him the money and the farmer annoyedly denies payment. 
                Tanjiro slaps coins into his hand and thanks him, while the farmer yelps in pain. 
                After repairing it, Tanjiro finds Nezuko has dug herself into a dirt tunnel; her scared expression showing her great reluctance to let sunlight touch her.
                Unsure if she can fit, or even understand, Tanjiro slowly asks if she could shrink herself similar to how she previously grew in size. 
                Eventually, Nezuko does as Tanjiro asks and fits inside. 
                With the basket on her back, Tanjiro sets out to Mount Sagiri. 
                He finds a woman and asks for directions. 
                She tells him the mountain is across another but is worried since it is now dark. 
                Tanjiro reassures her that he will be safe.
                As night falls, Tanjiro and Nezuko find a small temple hut in the woods and decide to check it out. 
                As they near the hut, Tanjiro smells blood and worries about the possibility of a traveler being injured, rushing into the hut. 
                However, he instead finds a demon feasting upon the three dead residents. 
                The demon shoots the siblings a glance and warns them that this is his feasting grounds. 
                Upon seeing the bloodied bodies, Nezuko starts to salivate and Tanjiro goes into a state of shock at his first encounter with a man-eating demon.
                The demon suddenly realizes that Tanjiro is human and rushes out of the temple to kill him. 
                Tanjiro uses his hatchet to slash the demon by the neck, fending him away, but the wound immediately begins to heal. 
                The demon proceeds to outspeed the boy and pins him onto the ground with his agility and strength. 
                Before Tanjiro can be killed, Nezuko, fighting the urge to eat the bodies, comes to her brother's aid and kicks his head clean off from his neck while Tanjiro watches, shocked over her ability to kill.
                However, the demon's body continues to attack Tanjiro despite being beheaded, prompting Nezuko to give the headless body another kick. 
                The severed head yells at Tanjiro, asking why a demon would travel with a human. 
                He runs to grab Nezuko, distracting her and Tanjiro while growing another pair of arms from the detached head. 
                He charges at Tanjiro but the boy proceeds to headbutt and pin him onto a nearby tree with his hatchet handle.
                Tanjiro runs off into the forest to look for Nezuko, finding her under attack from the headless body which continues to kick her dangerously close to a cliff's edge. 
                He tackles the body off the cliff and is narrowly saved by Nezuko, making the headless body fall straight onto the ground below. 
                Although the impact from the fall of his body causes the demon great pain, knocking him unconscious, it does not kill him.
                The siblings return to the demon's head pinned by the tree and Tanjiro draws out a small knife, intending to end the demon's life. 
                However, despite knowing that it will save the lives of others, he hesitates to kill it. 
                Enough time in his hesitation passes for a person wearing a strange mask to approach him from behind and tells him that the knife that he is holding cannot kill the demon.

            <h1>Chapter 3 "Return by Dawn"</h1>
            <p>
                Before embarking on his journey to become a Demon Slayer, Tanjiro creates a journal to log his training for Nezuko to read, who is still asleep. 
                As he worriedly looks at her, Sakonji tells him his training shall now begin.
                He explains that the Demon Slayer Corps is comprised of several hundred members, and though it isn’t recognized by the government, it has been active since ancient times. 
                Sakonji goes on to explain demons to him; it is unknown how they first appeared but what is certain is their physical prowess and powerful regeneration.
                Some can shape shift and other have completely different powers entirely; the only way to kill them is with sunlight or using a special sword. 
                Though humanity fights back against demons with their slow regeneration and higher mortality, they continue to do so to protect others.
                Sakonji explains that as a trainer among many, he will guide Tanjiro through his own path unique to get stronger using the mountain, and that he must attend the Final Selection held on Mount Fujikasane to become a Demon Slayer; he alone will decide if he is fit to enter the selection.
                After days of repeatedly descending the mountain, Tanjiro is now able to dodge and weave through most of the traps hidden, thanks to his greater strength and becoming more adept at detecting scents. 
                Despite this, the traps continue to get more difficult and dangerous, with Sakonji now deploying them laden with knives and spikes. 
                After being given a sword to simulate real battle conditions however, his movements become hampered and Tanjiro becomes caught in the traps again.
                For the next several days, Tanjiro is tasked with swinging his blade over and over again, throughout the day, with Sakonji increasing the difficulty each time. 
                Then, he is explained the mechanics of swords: the blade is strong vertically but is weak horizontal, and can be prone to breaking. Sakonji demonstrate that applying force along the blade is the correct way to cut, as well as threatening Tanjiro severely should he break the blade.
                In the next lesson, Tanjiro is repeatedly felled by Sakonji, with the goal of teaching him to arise quickly in battle. 
                Then, Sakonji instructs Tanjiro to charge towards him while armed with a sword; despite Tanjiro running at his full speed, he is flipped in the air effortlessly by the old trainer.
                Next, Tanjiro is taught a special breathing technique called Total Concentration Breathing, and Sakonji also explains he will then teach him all ten forms of Water Breathing. 
                Told to take a deep breath to allow oxygen to flow throughout his body, Tanjiro takes a long inhale, only to be slapped in the stomach by Sakonji for his incorrect method. 
                Next, he moves on to the forms to use while using Total Concentration, only to be repeatedly slapped again for being wrong and for not bracing his stomach. 
                Later, Sakonji instructs him to “become one with the water”, which involves kicking Tanjiro off a cliff into a cold river.
                Six months have passed since his training has commenced and Nezuko still remains asleep. 
                Though Sakonji had summoned a doctor to check on her, nothing is determined to be wrong with her. 
                Scared that he may find her dead one morning, he worries for her wellbeing everyday. 
                Tanjiro now makes his final instructed climb and descent of Mount Sagiri; he is able to traverse the harsh landscape and defeat the traps successfully.
                All of the sudden, one year after taking him in as his student, Sakonji informs Tanjiro he has nothing more to teach to the boy, telling him his success is now up to him. 
                Walking through the forest, he takes Tanjiro to a clearing, the site of an immense boulder adorned with shide. 
                Sakonji tells Tanjiro that he will only allow him to enter Final Selection if he is able to slice it. 
                Shocked at the monumental task, Tanjiro calls out to his trainer, but Sakonji leaves without saying anything else.
                Taking a stance in front of the boulder, Tanjiro tries to slice it in an initial attempt, which promptly fails. All by himself, Tanjiro recalls all the previous lessons he was taught by Sakonji and trains himself to get stronger. 
                With the basic lessons in his journal, he practices them over and over again in an attempt to accomplish his goal. 
                For six months, he repeatedly attempts to slice it without success, and Tanjiro drops his sword one day in exhaustion, his hands severely callused through swinging his sword incessantly in failure.
                Feeling hopeless because of his lack of gain in training for so long, Tanjiro yells out his frustration and urges himself to keep going. He is suddenly silenced by the appearance of a young swordsman atop the boulder, wearing a fox mask. 
                The young man tells him that whining is inappropriate, while Tanjiro is stunned by his sudden and unexpected appearance. 
                He leaps off the boulder and kicks Tanjiro, deflecting his sword with his own wooden blade.
                The swordsman instructs Tanjiro to charge at him; when Tanjiro becomes worried since he has a real blade against his wooden practice sword, the young man only laughs at his concern and taunts him by thinking he had a chance of hitting him. 
                He lunges at Tanjiro with incredible speed and informs the boy he is much stronger than him because he has sliced that boulder. 
                He leaps into the trees and speeds around the forest in a display of his skills, before knocking Tanjiro to the ground.
                The swordsman admonishes Tanjiro for not mastering anything; in particular, the breathing techniques by Sakonji. 
                Realizing that the stranger knows his trainer, Tanjiro is told he had only known the techniques as a fact and have never properly learned it, much less used it. 
                As he attacks Tanjiro, the swordsman tells him to pound the lessons into his body to never forget them. 
                Tanjiro responds by saying he has been trying for so long without making improvement but the swordsman responds by telling him the only way he can now go is forward.
                Commanding the boy to attack him again, Tanjiro sprints towards the swordsman with all his energy; his swing is promptly dodged and the swordsman slams his blade into Tanjiro’s chin, knocking him unconscious. 
                With the boy on the ground unconscious, the swordsman mutters, “I’m leaving the rest to you", as a young girl enters the forest.
                When Tanjiro awakens, the girl asks if he is alright. 
                Tanjiro tells her about the incredible strike he was dealt and how no movement was wasted by the swordsman. 
                When he wishes to be as powerful as him, the girl tells him he can too since she will be looking after him, smiling gently as Tanjiro notes her pretty appearance. 
                The girl’s name is Makomo, while the swordsman of earlier is named Sabito. 
                Makomo corrects the mistakes and nuances Tanjiro has made to better his form. 
                When asked where she is from, Makomo doesn’t respond, only telling him that she and Sabito love Sakonji dearly.
                Makomo and Sabito were raised by Sakonji after they were orphaned, and she tells him that there are other children like them, always watching him. 
                Though confused by her strange, dreamy demeanour, Tanjiro is taught by Makomo the importance of Total Concentration Breathing; it accelerates both his blood circulation and heart rate, causing his temperature to spike and allowing him to match a demon’s strength while staying human.
                The vital lesson is to expand his lung capacity, in order to flood his body with air and allow his bones and muscles to gain strength. Confused at the mechanics of the technique, Tanjiro inquires how he can gain such power; Makomo only tells him, “Train to death”.
                Tanjiro works on expanding his lung capacity while swinging his sword, a laborious and painful task. Each time he spars with Sabito to improve his technique, the swordsman proves too fast to hit. 
                Six months after meeting the two, Tanjiro and Sabito have a final match, with Sabito now armed with a real sword. 
                As Makomo watches the two ready for their clash, Tanjiro announces that he will win this day. As he takes a long breath to strengthen himself, he notes that head-on battles are simple; the stronger and faster person wins. 
                He and Sabito lunge towards each other but it is Tanjiro who makes the first swing, ending the fight.
                Tanjiro’s blade slices Sabito’s mask, which falls and reveals his face, curved into a relieved smile. 
                Makomo sees this and smiles gently as well. 
                She commends Tanjiro’s success and says a final message of advice: “Win, okay, Tanijro. Beat that guy, too?”. 
                She and Sabito disappear from the forest in a haze, and Tanjiro realizes that his swing, believing had slashed Sabito's mask, has actually sliced the boulder in half.
