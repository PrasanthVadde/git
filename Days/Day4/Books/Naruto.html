            <h1>Chapter 1 "Naruto Uzumaki!!"</h1>

            <p>
                Once upon a time, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox devastated the shinobi village of Konohagakure, and was only stopped when the village's leader, the Fourth Hokage, gave up his life to seal it within the body of an infant. 
                Twelve years later, a young orphan boy named Naruto Uzumaki regularly pulls pranks and is constantly causing trouble around the village. 
                The villagers dislike him for it, but having no parents or friends, Naruto craves even negative attention.
                One day, Naruto paints all over the Hokage Monument, leading to the current village leader, the Third Hokage, to come and see. 
                Naruto is eventually brought back to class at the Academy by his teacher, Iruka Umino. 
                At class, Iruka has each student perform the Transformation Technique in preparation for the class's final exam tomorrow, but Naruto instead uses the Sexy Technique.
                After class, Iruka has Naruto clean up his earlier mess, before deciding to treat Naruto to ramen later that night. 
                There, Iruka asks why Naruto would perform the prank, and Naruto announces his own plans to become Hokage, even though he is incapable of performing even the most basic of techniques. 
                At the final exam, Naruto is unable to use the Clone Technique and Iruka subsequently fails him. 
                Afterwards, a more sympathetic instructor, Mizuki, tells him an apparent secret, while the Third Hokage talks to Iruka about how Iruka also lost his parents in the Nine-Tails attack, and that he relates to Naruto that way.
                That night, Naruto manages to steal the Scroll of Seals, believing that if he can learn one of its secret techniques, he will finally be allowed to continue on to the ranks of the ninja. After successfully stealing the scroll, a search is placed on Naruto, and he is caught by Iruka after only learning one technique. 
                Realising that Naruto has been tricked, Iruka protects him from Mizuki's attack, Mizuki planning to take the scroll for himself.
                To sway Naruto to his side, Mizuki tells Naruto the truth: Naruto is the boy that had the Nine-Tails sealed inside of him, and that a decree was placed preventing anyone from talking about it, barring Naruto from learning about it. 
                He goes on to explain that the villagers hate him for the monster he contains and that Iruka, his parents having been killed by the Nine-Tails, must hate him the most. 
                Mizuki attempts to kill Naruto, but Iruka blocks the attack, revealing his own past to Naruto. 
                Overwhelmed, Naruto flees into the woods.
                Iruka and Mizuki confront each other while Naruto listens behind a tree. 
                Mizuki berates Iruka, claiming Naruto will use the scroll to get revenge. 
                Iruka says this is not the case as he does not blame Naruto for the beast's actions, before acknowledging him as his friend. 
                Having finally made a friend, Naruto reveals himself and uses his newly mastered Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to defeat Mizuki, while the Third Hokage calls off the search. 
                Amazed by the complicated technique Naruto has learned, Iruka officially makes Naruto a ninja in training and puts faith in him becoming Hokage.

            <h1>Chapter 2 "Konohamaru!!"</h1>

            <p>
                While preparing for his life as a ninja, Naruto Uzumaki meets the young Konohamaru in the middle of an attempt on the Third Hokage's life. 
                When he fails, Konohamaru asks to train under Naruto, hoping that his Sexy Technique will be enough to defeat the Third and become Hokage. 
                Planning to become Hokage himself, Naruto asks why he would want the title. 
                Konohamaru explains that, as the Third's grandson, people only identify him as such and not by his name. 
                He hopes that, by becoming Hokage, people will acknowledge him, not because he's the grandson of the latter.
                Knowing what Konohamaru is going through, Naruto agrees to train him. 
                Ebisu, Konohamaru's tutor, believes the "Nine-Tails boy" is a bad influence and attempts to stop their training. 
                Konohamaru uses his perfected Sexy Technique to try and get rid of Ebisu, but it has no effect. 
                Naruto follows up with his Harem Technique, which affected Ebisu and a proof he's also a pervert. 
                Seeing that he still has much to learn, Konohamaru breaks off his student-teacher relationship with Naruto, as depending on Naruto's help to become Hokage would mean he is unfit for the position.

            <h1>Chapter 3 "Sasuke Uchiha!!"</h1>

            <p>
                Naruto Uzumaki, having finally passed his graduation exam, heads to the ninja academy to be put into three man squads. 
                He ends up paired with Sakura Haruno, a girl Naruto has a crush on, and Sasuke Uchiha, the person Naruto considers to be his rival. 
                After Sakura shows disappointment at being paired with Naruto, and only happy about being paired with Sasuke, Naruto devises a plan. 
                During lunch Naruto ambushes Sasuke and ties him up, then uses the Transformation Technique to turn into Sasuke. 
                Approaching Sakura as Sasuke, Naruto goes about finding what she thinks of him. 
                Interrupted by having to go to the bathroom (right before he can get a kiss from Sakura), Sasuke manages to get free. 
                Sasuke passes Sakura and she pesters him about their time together a few moments earlier. 
                She then goes about insulting Naruto, and makes fun of him having no parents. 
                Sasuke retorts angrily, saying she makes him sick. 
                Deciding she has been too mean to Naruto, she decides she should try and be nicer to him from now on.
