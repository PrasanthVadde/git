            In 2006, Grady Hendrix of Film Comment, published by the Film Society of Lincoln Center cited Varma as "Bombay's Most Successful Maverick" for his works on experimental films.
            Starting his career as a civil engineer, he made an entry into Telugu cinema with the path-breaking crime thriller, Siva (1989) featured at the 13th IFFI' 90 Indian Panorama mainstream section, and has won Varma, the state Nandi Awards for Best direction, Best first film of a director, and the Filmfare Award for Best Film â€“ Telugu.

            My favourite movies are Rakhta Charitra filimography, Kshana Kshanam and Shiva and many like deyyam, raath etc..
            Apart from his films i personally likes his philosophy, ideology.
